# Arduino-Blynk-Terminal
Well, out of blue, I decided to code a group of useful commands to interact with Blynk termianl. In this code I'm going to communicate with Arduino over ethernet. This project can be practical in IoT devices.

I am going to write a lib which contains the whole commands ...
this is the start :)
lets move forward ...

..... 
Just in case I will mention that I am going to use Arduino Mega and W5100 ethernet shield !
